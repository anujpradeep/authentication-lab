Question 1:
By default, its session-based authentication. 
Typically maintained by the browser cookies to store and manage sessions.

Question 2:
-a or --auth is used for basic authentication.

Question 3:
Differences between session vs token
Session:
    - Stateful
    - session is saved on the server/cookies.
    - Security is generally secure, but can be hijacked if not properly protected

Token:
    - Stateless
    - Token is stored by the client
    - Security is much better compared to sessions. Tokens can have a set time on them, which means they can be short, or long depending on what the user needs.


Token has better security as you dont have to send the username and password with each request. It is also stateless.

Question 4:
After clicking Login with google
    - Redirects to google Oauth2.0 authorization server, includes permissions that bitbucket needs, and a URI to redirect after successful authentication
    - User needs to grant permissions, if agreed, authenticated with Google and grants permission for bitbucket to access their google account data
        Google will also generate a one time authorization code and sends it to the redirect URI
    - Bitbucket will receive the code, and exchange the code for access to Google OAuth server, where they can refresh the tokens
    - Bitbucket gains access and has a session on the platform.
